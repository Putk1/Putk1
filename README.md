# Hi, I'm Petrus ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year Computer Science student still figuring what to specialize in. As of now my list of skills and projects is really nonexistent, but I'll be sure to start making the list longer in the upcoming years.

Right now I am dabbling in python and have also recently started learning digital fabrication.
